A Hippogriff was a magical beast that had the front legs, wings, and head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and 
tail of a horse. It was very similar to another magical creature, the Griffin, with the horse rear replacing the lion 
rear.

The breeding of fancy Hippogriffs was an established wizarding career, with known breeders including Newton Scamander's 
mother. Images of fancy Hippogriffs were sometimes put onto calendars.

A hippogriff was one rare possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.

## Description

### Physical appearance

The physical features of the Hippogriff

Hippogriffs had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of giant eagles, with 
cruel, steel-coloured beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and 
deadly-looking.

It was stated that, once you get over the initial shock of seeing something that's half horse, half bird, you start to 
appreciate the hippogriffs' gleaming coats, which changed smoothly from feathers to hair. Hippogriffs came in 
several different colours, including: stormy grey, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky

### Behaviour
Hippogriffs were carnivorous and were extremely dangerous until tamed, which should only be attempted by a trained witch 
or wizard. The diet of the Hippogriff consisted mainly of insects, birds, and small mammals such as ferrets. They would 
sometimes paw at the ground for worms if no other food was readily available.

When breeding, Hippogriffs built nests on the ground, and laid only a single, fragile egg. The egg usually hatched in 
twenty-four hours. Infant Hippogriffs were capable of Flight within a week, but it took many months before they were 
strong enough to accompany their parents on long journeys.

## Etiquette
When Humans approach Hippogriffs, a proper etiquette must be maintained to avoid danger. Hippogriffs were intensely 
proud creatures, and an individual must show proper respect by bowing to them, and waiting for them to bow in return 
before approaching. Eye contact should be maintained at all times, without a single blink.

The Hippogriff should be allowed to make the first move, as that was polite. If offended, it might attack. Hippogriffs 
were tamable, but only by experts in their care (such as Rubeus Hagrid, Care of Magical Creatures Professor and 
Gamekeeper at Hogwarts).

Although proud, Hippogriffs could also be fiercely loyal and protective of those who had earned their trust, as 
demonstrated by Buckbeak on at least two occasions: when he attacked Severus Snape in defence of Harry Potter during the 
Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and again when he led Hogwarts' Thestrals in attacking Voldemort's giants during the 
Battle of Hogwarts.
