The Thestral is a breed of winged horse with a skeletal body, face with reptilian features, and wide, leathery wings 
that resemble a bat's. They are native to the British Isles and Ireland, though they have been spotted in parts of 
France and the Iberian Peninsula.They are very rare, and are considered dangerous by the British Ministry of Magic.
Thestrals are, undeservedly, known as omens of misfortune and aggression by many wizards because they are visible only 
to those who have witnessed death at least once or due to their somewhat grim, gaunt and ghostly appearance.

Due to Thestrals' classification as XXXX, only experienced wizards should try to handle Thestrals. Breeding as well as 
owning these beasts may be discouraged or even illegal without Ministry consent; in fact, wizards that live in areas not 
protected against Muggles are forced by law to perform Disillusionment Charms on their Thestrals regularly.

A Thestral is also one possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.

## Description 

### Physical appearance
Being a type of winged horse, most of their anatomy is identical to a horse, excluding their large wings that sprout 
from their back. Unlike the Abraxan, another breed of winged horses, Thestral's wings do not possess any feathers at 
all; they have vast, black and leathery wings that are more similar to those of bats.

Their fleshless, lustrous bodies are covered with a translucent and glossy coat. This smooth and dark skin is a bit 
slippery and so thin that Thestral's bones are clearly defined through the entire extension of their sleek bodies. These 
eerie horses have long black manes, as well as a large tail, either with flowing black hair, like horses or ending in a 
tuft, like zebras. Another distinction is their sharp fangs used to seize and slash their prey.

### Behaviour
Thestrals are social creatures who live in herds. Professor Rubeus Hagrid stated that they are "dead clever". In fact 
trained Thestrals are smart enough to understand their rider's words when they ask to travel to a specific location.

These magical creatures can be found in dark environments and the forest is their natural habitat. They communicate with 
each other through a shrill and strange shriek that resembles some sort of monstrous bird.

They appear to be loyal creatures, able to discern a friend from an enemy and offering help to humans in need of 
transportation. Thestrals would forcefully attack anyone or anything they see as a threat and in the unusual case of 
domesticated Thestrals, any enemy of its owners. Thestrals are not marks of ill omen, nor 
(their spooky appearance notwithstanding) are they in any way threatening to humans, always allowing for the fright that 
the first sight of them tends to give the observer.

In the Battle of Hogwarts, Hogwarts' trained flock of Thestrals cooperated with Buckbeak, the Hippogriff, to attack the 
Giants fighting for Voldemort. It's unclear whether or not wild herds can similarly cooperate with other species.
