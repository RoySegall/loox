A Puffskein is a small magical beast covered in soft fur and spherical in shape. It is a popular wizarding pet found 
worldwide, that does not object to being cuddled or thrown about.

The collective noun used to refer to a group of puffskeins is poffle.

## Nature
The Puffskein is a scavenger, eating anything from leftovers to spiders, but it particularly likes to use its long thin 
pink tongue to eat wizards' bogeys while they sleep.

The Puffskein is easy to care for, and they are known to emit a low humming sound when they are content. Shaved 
(or trimmed with a clipper) Puffskein hair has magical properties, and is useful as a potion ingredient, such as in 
Zygmunt Budge's variation of the Laughing Potion, which requires a few handfuls.

## History
According to Albus Dumbledore, a copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them resides in almost every wizarding 
household in the country, used by generations of wizards, in search of the best way, to cure their pet Puffskein of 
drinking out of the toilet.

On Boxing Day in 1986, Rubeus Hagrid showed Jacob's sibling a group of Puffskeins attracted by scraps from the Christmas 
Feast. He said they appeared on every Boxing Day after he accidentally discovered them while holding some food many years 
ago.

During the 1988â€“1989 school year at Hogwarts, Professor Silvanus Kettleburn taught his fifth year Care of Magical 
Creatures students about how to handle Puffskeins.

Ron Weasley owned a Puffskein at one point. Its demise is attributed to Fred, who supposedly used it for Bludger 
practise.

George Weasley reported that a nest of dead puffskeins was discovered by Molly Weasley at 12 Grimmauld Place under the 
sofa in the drawing room in August 1995.

Zygmunt Budge considered Puffskeins as largely pointless creatures, although invaluable for the Potioneer, and the fact 
that anyone would want such a tedious beast as a pet was quite beyond him.

The Magical Menagerie sold Puffskeins.

They were the favourite creature of the Gryffindor student Ben Copper at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
who attended the school in the 1980s.

They were modified by Fred and George to create Pygmy Puffs.

During the Calamity in the 2010s, several Puffskeins were turned into Foundables which were appeared throughout the 
Wizarding world, guarded by Confoundables. Volunteer wizards and witches who worked for the Statute of Secrecy Task 
Force had to retrieve these Confoundables using various spells, to return them to their rightful places.
