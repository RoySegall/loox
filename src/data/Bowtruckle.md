The Bowtruckle was a hand-sized, insect-eating, tree dwelling magical beast with long sharp fingers (two on each hand), 
brown eyes, and a general appearance of a flat-faced stick figure made of bark and twigs, which served well as 
camouflage in its natural habitat. They were immensely difficult to spot.

## Description
The Bowtruckle could be found in western England, southern Germany, and certain Scandinavian forests. A Bowtruckle 
served as a tree guardian for its home tree, which was usually a tree whose wood was of wand quality 
(such as a Wiggentree). The twig-like fingers were well adapted for digging out wood lice in trees and could also 
be used as a weapon against a foe when aimed at the eyes.

A group of Bowtruckles was called a branch.

It was generally a peaceful creature, but it may attempt to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree 
or itself, and was adept at dodging most types of charms. In order to take leaves or wood from a Bowtruckle's tree 
one would have to offer it wood lice or fairy eggs as a distraction.

## History
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had a Bowtruckle Island at the Great Lake. Newton Scamander used to go to it 
when he attended Hogwarts, and gained the trust of the Bowtruckles. In between February and June 1913, he took Leta 
Lestrange in an effort to cheer her up.[7]

Newt Scamander kept a branch of Bowtruckles in his suitcase by December 1926.[8]

During the 1987–1988 school year, Bowtruckles were studied by fourth year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, taught by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn, who described them to be slipperier than 
Frog Spawn Soap.[9] One of Kettleburn's personal Bowtruckles was named by Jacob's sibling, and was named either Jacob, 
Barnaby Junior or Newt, after a person of the same name.[10]

Bowtruckles were studied by fifth year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts during 1995–1996 school year, 
taught by substitute Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.[3]

In the 21st century, a branch of bowtruckles was unleashed as a Confoundable by the Calamity and had to be dealt with by 
the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and returned to the Black Forest in Germany.[11]
